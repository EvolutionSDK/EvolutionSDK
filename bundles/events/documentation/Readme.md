Events Bundle
=============
The events bundle is probabbly the most important bundle in Evolution. With an event based framework you can trigger any event to happen on any bundle from any file. 

Usage
=====
There are no defined functions in events rather it uses a catch all. For example running.

```php
<?php

e::$events->whatIsYourName(...args...);
```

Would start by looking in every bundle for `e::$bundle->_on_whatIsYourName(...args...);` it will run every function that matches this criteria on every bundle, and return the results in an array formatted like this (Regardless of the amount of events that have returned).

```php
<?php

array(
	"Bundles\SQL\Bundle" => 'SQL Bundle',
	"Bundles\Members\Bundle" => 'Members Bundle',
	"Bundles\Cache\Bundle" => 'Caching Bundle',
	"Bundles\Security\Bundle" => 'Security Bundle',
	"Bundles\Unit\Bundle" => 'Unit Testing Bundle'
);
```

The Master-Events File
======================
Events can be manually enabled or disabled from the `master-events.yaml` file located in your sites `./configure` directory. There are two ways of disabling events.

## Block events by their handlers

You can block bundles form handling any and all events using the `handlers:` key.

	handlers: 
		Bundles\Members\Bundle: enabled
		Bundles\Session\Bundle: disabled

In the above example any events could be caught by the Members Bundle, but not the Session Bundle.

## Block specific events entirely

You can also block certain events from running entirely by using the `events:` key.

	events: 
		framework_loaded: enabled
		after_framework_loaded: disabled

In the above example the `framework_loaded` event will still operate normally. However any events that match `after_framework_loaded` will not be run.

Possible problems in bundles
============================
If you are using our [SQL Bundle](http://github.com/EvolutionSDK/sql) and override the `_on_framework_loaded()` method you will need to run the `parent::_on_framework_loaded()` method inside your event. This is true for anytime you override a preexisint parent event.
